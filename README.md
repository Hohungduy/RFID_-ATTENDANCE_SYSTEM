# RFID_-ATTENDANCE_SYSTEM
subject project

Hi everyone!
I am a beginner in embedded system. My field is: Embedded Linux, Embedded programming, machine-learning, apps in Android, web interface with PHP, Mysql, CCS, HTML 
This project was made in subject project. Source code in this project was pulled from Pimylifeup website. We have just added some feature in website and some function with regard to capture photo.
The extensibility of this project is adding machine learning to recornize face and adding Fingerprint recognition. Our work in future is redesign system specification, system requirement and design new hardware and software for this purpose.
Thanks,
Duy
